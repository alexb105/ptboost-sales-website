              I'm a web developer who specializes in high-converting websites. After working with businesses across different industries, 
              I noticed personal trainers face a unique challenge: <span className="font-bold text-foreground">you need a professional online presence, but agencies charge ¬£2,000-5,000.</span>
            </p>

            <p>
              Most PTs can't justify spending thousands on a website when you're just starting to scale. But without one, 
              you're stuck competing on Instagram where the algorithm controls your business. 
              <span className="font-bold text-foreground"> That's why I'm offering professional websites for just ¬£39 ‚Äî but only for the first 50 sites.</span>
            </p>

              After 50 sites, the price goes to ¬£299. This is a one-time opportunity to get in early.
